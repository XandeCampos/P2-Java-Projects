# ComplementaCCC

ComplementaCCC is a system made to manage a variety of necessities of a college course, like creating and managing students, a FAQ area, managing students research papers, trainee programs, extension programs and more.

Although it was initially created to manage a Computer Science course (CCC means "Computer Science Center" in portuguese"), it can fit almost any major a college can offer.

# Targets

My main target was to correctly apply OOP principles while coding and to organize it in an easily understandable way for anyone who reads it. Hope i got that part right!
